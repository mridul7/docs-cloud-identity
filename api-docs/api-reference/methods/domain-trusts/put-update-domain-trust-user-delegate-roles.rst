Update domain trust user delegate roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    PUT /v2.0/RAX-AUTH/trusts/{trustId}/delegates/users/{userId}/roles

Update domain trust user delegate roles.

.. note::

    - A user-admin and user-manager can update the roles for a user delegate
      if their domain matches the domain of the user.
    - Users with the role ``identity:domain-trust-admin`` can update roles
      for any user delegate.
    - Roles can be delegated to a user only if they are part of the domain
      trust roles assignment.
